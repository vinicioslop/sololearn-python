# Remainder

# We need to distribute textbooks to students.
# There are 37 pupils in the class and each one should get 2 textbooks.
# The total number ofbooks available for distribution is 76.

# Task
# Write a program to calculate and output how many books will be left after the distribution.

# Hint
# You just need to find the remainder from dividing 76 and total number of needed books (37*2),
# then print the result.

# Use the modulo operator (%) to get the remainder.
