# List Operations

# You are building a search system and need to search for the
# character 'a' in an input string.
# Output "Match" if 'a' is found in the string, and "No match"
# if it's not.

# Sample Input
# great

# Sample Output
# Match

# To check if an item is in a list, you can use the in operator.

s = input()
# your code goes here
if 'a' in s:
    print("Match")
else:
    print("No match")
