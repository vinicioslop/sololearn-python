# if Statements

# You have been asked to coordinate the dance school competitionâ€¤
# The terms of the competition are as follows:
# - if the score is 80 or more the participant gets a certificate
# - if the score is 90 or more the participant gets a certificate
#   and also is admitted to the school.
# The given program takes the score as input.

# Task
# Complete the program that will output "certificate" if the score
# is greater than or equal to 80. On top of that, the program should
# also output "admitted" if the score is greater than or equal to 90.

# Sample Input
# 91

# Sample Output
# certificate
# admitted

# Hint
# Use nested if statements to handle all the conditions.

# Don't output anything if the score is less than 80.

score = int(input())
#your code goes here
if score >= 80:
    print("certificate")
    if score >= 90:
        print("admitted")
