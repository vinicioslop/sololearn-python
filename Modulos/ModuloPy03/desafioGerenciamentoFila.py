# List Functions

# You are working on a queue management program.
# The queue is represented by a list.
# Write a program to take an input, add it to the end of
# the queue and output the resulting list.

# The append() method can be used to add new items to the list.
queue = ["John", "James", "Amy"]

txt = input()
# your code goes here
queue.append(txt)
print(queue)
