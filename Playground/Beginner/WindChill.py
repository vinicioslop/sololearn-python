# Tier: 1-Beginner

# Windchill combines the actual temperature with the wind
# speed to calculate the windchill factor, or what the
# perceived temperature is versus the actual temperature.

# User Stories

#  - User can select the measurement system calculations
#    will be performed in - Metric or English
#    User can enter the actual temperature and the wind
#    speed

#  - User can press the Calculate button to display the
#    wind chill

#  - User will receive an error message when Calculate
#    is clicked if data values are not entered

# Bonus features

#  - User will receive an error message when Calculate is
#    clicked if the resulting wind chill factor is greater
#    than or equal to the actual temperature. Since this
#    signifies an internal error in the calculation you may
#    also satisfy this requirement using an assertion

#  - User will be prompted to enter new data values if
#    Calculate is pressed without first changing at least
#    one of the input fields

#  - User will see an updated wind chill factor whenever
#    new actual temperature or wind speed values are entered,
#    without being required to click the Calculate button
